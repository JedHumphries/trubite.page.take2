   <h1 id="title">Manchester United</h1>

  <h2> The Beginning </h2>
  <p>Manchester United Football Club was first formed in 1878, albeit under a different name - Newton Heath LYR (Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway). Little suspecting the impact they were about to have on the national, even global game, the workers in the railway yard at Newton Heath indulged their passion for association football with games against other departments of the LYR and other railway companies.

Indeed, when the Football League was formed in 1888, Newton Heath did not consider themselves good enough to become founder members alongside the likes of Blackburn Rovers and Preston North End. Instead, they waited until 1892 to make their entrance, joining the league at Division One level but were sadly relegated to Division Two after just two seasons in the top flight.

Financial problems plagued the club and, by the start of the 20th Century, it seemed they were destined for extinction. The team was saved, however, by local brewery owner John Henry Davies. Legend has it that he learned of the club's plight when he found a dog belonging to captain Harry Stafford.

Davies decided to invest in Newton Heath, in return for some interest in running it. This led to a change of name and, after several alternatives including Manchester Central and Manchester Celtic were rejected, Manchester United was born in April/May of 1902.<p/>

  <h2> Trophies & Tragedies</h2>
  <p> In 1907/08 United won the Football League title for the first time. As champions, United played in the first-ever Charity Shield in 1908. They duly won the trophy, beating Southern League champions QPR 4-0 thanks largely to a hat-trick from Sandy's namesake, Jimmy Turnbull. The third trophy to be added to the club's honours board was the FA Cup, at the end of a tremendous run in 1909. United beat Bristol City 1-0 in the final, thanks to Sandy Turnbull's winner.
    United were crowned League champions for the second time at the end of their first full season at Old Trafford - 1910/1911. The Reds clinched the title at home on the final day of the season, beating Sunderland 5-1 with Harold Halse grabbing two of the goals. Halse also scored six goals as United beat Swindon Town 8-4 to clinch the Charity Shield.</p>
    <p>In 1945 after many defeats and yoyoing league finishes Matt Busby (1945–1969) took over as the new manager starting a new phase in united's history. And after 39 years since lifting the FA for the first time, now under Matt Busby they had done it again in 1948 the club's first major honour since winning the League Championship in 1911.
    The Flood gates had opened under the management of Matt Bubsy with new young players lifting the league trophy again in 1951/52 1955/56 and 1956/57.</p>
    <p>As United headed off into Europe to play the second leg of a tie against Red Star Belgrade. Again they won 5-4, this time on aggregate but, on the way home, the celebrations were cut short by tragedy.

After refuelling in Munich on 6 February 1958, the United aeroplane crashed, killing 22 people, including seven players – Byrne, Colman, Jones, Pegg, Taylor, Geoff Bent and Liam Whelan. Duncan Edwards died of his injuries 15 days later in a German hospital. The club, the city of Manchester and the English game entered a long period of mourning. It seemed inconceivable that United could recover from such an appalling loss.
    After building one of the greatest teams seen in England, Matt Busby had to start all over again at the start of the 1960s. The Munich Air Disaster had robbed him, and football, of some of the era's greatest players. But once the great manager had recovered from his own injuries, he set about forging another side to take the world by storm going on to win many more titles against all odds.</p>
    <p> After the highs of Sir Matt Busby another new legend of english football come to be in charge of united and his name was Alex Ferguson (1986–2013).
      Alex Ferguson would go on to win 2 Champions League titles, 13 Premier League titles, 5 FA Cups, 4 League Cups and 1 European Cup Winners' Cup and is the only english club to do the "Double" twice and the only club in history to do the "Triple" under Ferguson one of the most successful managers of all time.</p>
    
    
    
  <h2> The Present </h2>
    <p> After many years of success under Sir Matt Busby and Alex Ferguson united have yet to achive the highs that once was. After Ferguson announced his retirement in 2013 David Moyes arrived from Everton, tasked with following in the footsteps of British football's most successful manager.

It proved to be too tall an order for the Scot, despite his impressive if trophy-less track record at Goodison Park. Towards the end of a disappointing 2013/14 season, with United unable to win any of the cup competitions and lying in seventh place, it was announced that Moyes had left the club.</p> 
      <p>Louis van Gaal's appointmentas the permanent new manager but despite a decent start to 2015/16 An early exit in the League Cup, at home to Middlesbrough on penalties, was more than compensated for by a stirring run in the FA Cup as van Gaal's men brought the trophy back to Old Trafford for a record-equalling 12th time overall and the first time since 2004. But with United's sometimes patchy league form not good enough to secure a top-four position and a place in the Champions League, media speculation about the manager's future was rife. Forty-eight hours after his team won the cup final at Wembley, van Gaal and the club parted company - his tenure was over, two years into a three-year contract.</p>
      <p>Intense speculation that Jose Mourinho would be appointed as United's new manager proved to be accurate on Friday 27 May 2016 when the club announced his arrival. By the time the new 2016/17 Premier League season kicked off, the new boss had already collected his first piece of silverware the Community Shield By the end of Mourinho’s debut season at Old Trafford he had added two more trophies, the League Cup sealed with victory over Southampton thanks to Zlatan’s late Wembley winner and, thrillingly, the Europa League, that trophy completing United’s full set of honours after a cup final triumph over Ajax in Stockholm. The 2018/19 season had a promising start but could not be maintained and in December, with the team placed sixth in the Premier League table, the club decided to part company with Mourinho.</p>
    <p>Enter former Reds striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who was appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the campaign. After winning 14 of his first 19 matches in charge, Solskjaer was appointed permanent manager on a three-year deal. Going four straight seasons without a trophy on 20th November 2021, Solskjaer left his role as manager. Former midfielder Michael Carrick took charge for the next three games, before the appointment of Ralf Rangnick as interim manager until the end of the season.</p>
